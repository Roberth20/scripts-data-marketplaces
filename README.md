# Dashboard to scrap and retrieve data from Mercado Libre

*Note:* The original idea was to build a small repository with scripts for scraping data from some marketplaces using web scraping and APIs. Due to difficulties in accessing data from sellers or the web itself, the idea moves up to building a dashboard for Mercado Libre. This will work as an easy guide to finding trends in products for e-commerce in Latin America.

## Setup

The file `Dapp.py` is the main file of the program, and the folder *App* has to be the root to make it easy for Dash to find the folders. Also, in the folder *instance* you have to load the three setting parameters for the app.
